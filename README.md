# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




Known Issues and To Be Implemented:

~~- Creating a repeat expense with a date in the past can cause issues if the next date for the expense to repeat has already passed, causing the expense not to repeat~~
~~- When viewing expenses, show the user if the expense is a repeating one or not~~

- Creating a repeat expense with a date in the past can cause issues if the next date for the expense to repeat has already passed, causing the expense not to repeat
